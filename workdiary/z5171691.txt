Week 1

Group formed. I created the Jira account and group chat channel. I was planning to start writing the initial version of the story & sprints section of the proposal. We agreed on a weekly meeting each Monday at 7 pm. However, the outcome was not so good as the proposal was not even started by the end of week 1. I wrote about 40 sprints in Jira backlog for the whole project, the format of them yet to be confirmed. I also wrote the test API request with flask and had a try with sqlalchemy (successful) and drew the basic concept of the UI of the homepage, login, register page, search result list and inside the introduction of the property page.

Week 2

For week 2, we set a goal of finishing our first draft of our project proposal. My part is to list the functional modules and briefly point out the technical keywords I would use in the system diagram. Also, my part of this project is confirmed as the back-end development (API service layer, Data Access Layer and Database). The outcome looks good to me. Our group further detailed the Jira backlog format and specified the task there. I also gave the group a brief about the tech I would use.

Week 3

Was able to successfully last week goal. For this week, the main job is to finish the proposal on time. I further detailed the technical spec and the inside contents of each layer I will be working on and let others draw the diagram of this whole project architecture. Based on the progress on Friday, we will be able to finish it on time. I will be working on the API programming and the communication between the service layer and database. Also, pay much attention to the logic behind each request, e.g. user authentication.
