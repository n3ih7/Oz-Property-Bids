Week 1

Group formed. I created the Jira account and group chat channel. I was planning to start writing the initial 
version of the story & sprints section of the proposal. We agreed on a weekly meeting each Monday at 7 pm. 
However, the outcome was not so good as the proposal was not even started by the end of week 1. I wrote about 
40 sprints in Jira backlog for the whole project, the format of them yet to be confirmed. I also wrote the 
test API request with flask and had a try with sqlalchemy (successful) and drew the basic concept of the UI 
of the homepage, login, register page, search result list and inside the introduction of the property page.

Week 2

For week 2, we set a goal of finishing our first draft of our project proposal. My part is to list the 
functional modules and briefly point out the technical keywords I would use in the system diagram. Also, my 
part of this project is confirmed as the back-end development (API service layer, Data Access Layer and 
Database). The outcome looks good to me. Our group further detailed the Jira backlog format and specified 
the task there. I also gave the group a brief about the tech I would use.

Week 3

Was able to successfully last week goal. For this week, the main job is to finish the proposal on time. 
I further detailed the technical spec and the inside contents of each layer I will be working on and let 
others draw the diagram of this whole project architecture. Based on the progress on Friday, we will be 
able to finish it on time. I will be working on the API programming and the communication between the 
service layer and database. Also, pay much attention to the logic behind each request, e.g. user authentica
-tion.

Week 4

Last week's goal was not a fully success due to the long weekend delay. For this week, we've planned to work
on spirit 1 for user login, signup, logout and basic search function. I assigned the task to each group member
and wrote sample code for back-end and uploaded on Friday 9 Oct on time. Till Sunday, I made some few fixes 
and it worked at local machine. Also, for this week, integrate back-end and front-end with Sachin and prepare 
for demo.

Week 5
I'm working on spirit 2 and make spirit 1 back end functions fully integrated with front-end till Tuesday night.
Will keep working for Thursday demo.
