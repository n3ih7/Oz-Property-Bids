Week 1:

I'm filling this one out late, but here is what happened in Week 1. We established our team and chose a project as well as a scrum master.
Our team vageuly set a goal of generating user stories but I think we were a bit too aimless in this, and as such were not succesful.

Week 2:
Filling this one out late as well. For week 2 we set a goal of finishing our first draft of our project proposal. My personal part in this was to write the introduction as well as create our sprint schedule from the generated user stories.
I also started working on our website in a seperate rep "front-end".

Week 3:
I was able to succesfully finish my Week 2 goal, and I think we will finish our proposal on time. I have also been researching Map APIs and potential services that we can offer that current competition does not.
As we finish our report I think we will beign our first sprint, and I hope to finish all the front-end objectives associated with it.
