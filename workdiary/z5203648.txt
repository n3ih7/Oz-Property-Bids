Week 1

Our group last_bus was formed. We've met on the week1 lab and scheduled weekly meetings, decided on our project is to build up a online property acution website.
I've learnt about Scrum and how to make user stoies properly to fit our requirement. I've worte a specific senario which helped to recognize our goals. 
There were lots of things to discuss and, still unclear.

Week 2

We have processed to work on divide sprints, stormming about the system architecture, API choosing and work out our user stories, but they were losing the right format. 
My part was to meet the cirteria of the user stories of the proposal. I have integrated the user stories and, fill out their missing part through my understanding of user stories. And also date the first sprint on our schedule.
